## About the template

It's a responsive template made for showcasing the testimonials or any other products with an slider to control the content.The slider functionality is achieved with js and the method that i've used to implement is i think  much simple and you'll understand it very quickly.
I've used flexbox for reponsive layout and i hope going through this template you'll also get a good understanding of how flexbox can be used to create  simple layouts fast and easily.
